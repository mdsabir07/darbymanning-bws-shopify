                    <p>Our Brothers We Stand plain T-shirts are proudly made in Bangladesh. The manufacture is overseen by a sourcing agent who help emerging designers source sustainably and ethically. Our T-shirts were cut and sewn by one of four factories the agent works closely with in Dhaka, Bangladesh. These factories have been selected because they are amongst the best in the country. The agent has its own team on the ground in Dhaka who visits the factories daily to monitor working conditions and ensure that nothing is subcontracted out to un-regulated factories.</p>
                    <p>In addition to these policies each of the factories is independently audited by the Fair Wear Foundation and GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard).</p>
